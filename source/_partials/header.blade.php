          <p>Our greatest opportunity now is to look into the future and think about the impact of adding 50% more people to the region between now and 2025. Until now, RTP has been a work venue surrounded by the communities that comprise the Triangle Region. We need to change that. We are pretty unique in that the greatest development potential for the Triangle region is right in the middle of it in RTP. We have 7,000 acres, which is about half the size of Manhattan. As a region, we need to focus on regional transportation, affordable housing, equitable public education, the environment, recreational amenities, our RDU airport and infrastructure. We need to make the right investments to ensure that the attractive characteristics of our region are sustained and enhanced as we grow.</p>

            <p>Our greatest opportunity now is to look into the future and think about the impact of adding 50% more people to the region between now and 2025. Until now, RTP has been a work venue surrounded by the communities that comprise the Triangle Region. We need to change that. We are pretty unique in that the greatest development potential for the Triangle region is right in the middle of it in RTP. We have 7,000 acres, which is about half the size of Manhattan. As a region, we need to focus on regional transportation, affordable housing, equitable public education, the environment, recreational amenities, our RDU airport and infrastructure. We need to make the right investments to ensure that the attractive characteristics of our region are sustained and enhanced as we grow.</p>

            <p>RTP has a unique opportunity because of how it is zoned. A lot of land is zoned exclusively to meet the commercial needs of the park, which fails to optimally utilize the resources that we have at our disposal.</p>

            <p>We have therefore started to consider how we might make better use of the land. We want to cultivate a certain livability here with open space and other amenities that make people feel more at home.</p>

            <p>For example, one thing we are examining is how we could change the entitlement system here to generate money that could go towards an inclusionary housing program in the area. That would place housing in proximity to public transit, job centers, and other amenities. Some of our efforts have also gone toward the Triangle Bikeway, the proposed 30 mile, 17-foot-wide trail that will connect Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and points in between â€“ including Hub RTP.</p>

            <p>The Triangle Bikeway is a component of the East Coast Greenway that is extending from Maine to Florida. The Triangle Bikeway It is a huge undertaking that will cost around $70 million, and it is still in the planning phases, but we want to enhance the position of RTP in that network so that people can see the promise that RTP holds.</p>

            <p>Already, confirmed tenants have announced they will bring 7,500 new jobs to RTP. Currently, about 25% of the 55,000 people that lost jobs during the pandemic are back to work. Over the next 18 months or so, we will be up to 62,000. The Hub is for companies that are either in the region or looking to come here who want to be very thoughtful and purposeful about their workplace strategy. Flex work seems like it is not working out as well as some thought it might, so employers might now be looking toward a more customized work experience for their employees. Many of the employers we have spoken with have indicated that their current workspace will not meet their future needs. Those spaces will then need to be rethought to attract and retain talent.</p>
