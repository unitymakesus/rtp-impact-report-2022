          <p>Research Triangle Park and its steward, Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina, are reinventing themselves for the future. Our new downtown, Hub RTP, is an ambitious roadmap to transform RTP into a destination for people to not only work, but to live, play and stay. This year, the first anniversary of Boxyard RTP proved that our community overwhelmingly supports RTP as more than a place to work. The groundbreaking of Horseshoe and the stabilization of Frontier RTP’s startup community build on that success.</p>

            <p>Research Triangle Park and its steward, Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina, are reinventing themselves for the future. Our new downtown, Hub RTP, is an ambitious roadmap to transform RTP into a destination for people to not only work, but to live, play and stay. This year, the first anniversary of Boxyard RTP proved that our community overwhelmingly supports RTP as more than a place to work. The groundbreaking of Horseshoe and the stabilization of Frontier RTP’s startup community build on that success.</p>

            <p>Our community propels our ambition and allows us to make RTP an engaging, accessible, welcoming place for all. With powerful collaborations and relationships as the backbone for everything we do, we’re working to build a more diverse, inclusive and equitable RTP supporting our 400 companies.</p>

            <p>While the work continues with transformational projects and initiatives, we also turn our focus to the explosive growth of the Triangle Region. Projecting the doubling in population by 2045, we are mindful of resultant impacts on housing availability and affordability, public education, transportation, environmental stewardship and resource optimization and open space. Guided by a mission to support the success of North Carolina and its residents, RTP looks forward to collaborating with our region’s communities and stakeholders to approach these challenges and opportunities together.</p>
